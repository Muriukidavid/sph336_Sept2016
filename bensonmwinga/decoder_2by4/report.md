Benson Mwinga I39/2212/2013 REPORT ON 2BY4DECODER INTRODUCTION

A line decoder is a device that changes the input code into a set of signals.
It takes an n-digit binary number and decodes it into 2n data lines. It does the reverse of encoding. 

The following truth able below was used as aguide line
